# Algorithm Visualizer ðŸŽ¯

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This Algorithm Visualizer is an educational web application designed to help students and developers understand how different sorting and searching algorithms work through interactive visualization. The project provides real-time visual representation of algorithm operations, making complex concepts easier to grasp.

### ðŸŽ“ Educational Purpose
- **Visual Learning**: Watch algorithms in action with step-by-step visualization
- **Interactive Experience**: Control the visualization speed and input your own data
- **Real-time Feedback**: See comparisons and swaps as they happen
- **Performance Analysis**: Track the number of operations and efficiency

### ðŸŒŸ Key Highlights
- Clean and modern user interface
- Real-time visualization of algorithm steps
- Audio feedback for better understanding
- Support for both sorting and searching algorithms
- Custom input and random data generation
- Performance metrics tracking

### ðŸŽ¨ User Interface
- **Modern Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive layout
- **Intuitive Controls**: Easy-to-use play, pause, and reset buttons
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded elements show algorithm operations
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid inputs
- **Responsive Layout**: Works well on different screen sizes
